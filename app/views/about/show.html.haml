    Taste-o-Code is a web project that aims to help you find and "taste" new programming languages. Unlike other similar services, Taste-o-Code doesn't focus on your programming skills or knowledge of algorithms. Instead, we want you to discover strengths and beauty of programming languages by solving a few simple, but still interesting, problems that each one of them is most suitable for. Taste-o-Code automatically tests your solutions and when you succeed rewards you with points that you can later use to "buy" and try even more languages.
